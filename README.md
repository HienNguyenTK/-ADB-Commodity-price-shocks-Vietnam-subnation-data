# Tracing the domestic effects of commodity-price shocks: Evidence from Vietnamese provinces
Objective and Purpose of the research
The project will examine the province-specific responses of GDP growth and consumer price inflation to global commodity price shocks in Vietnam specifically. The analysis will account for the fiscal and monetary dimensions’ policy stance in tracing the shocks’ impacts from short-run (1-4 quarters) to intermediate (five years) run across regions within the country. The empirical framework and lessons learned from the project will improve the understanding of the sub-national dynamics of macroeconomic aggregates to the external factors.

Scope of Work
The study will conduct region-specific structural vector autoregressions (SVARs): a global commodity price (3 aggregate price indices including agriculture, fuel, or metal prices; and 8 component agricultural price indices), a block of country/region-specific macroeconomic variables (GDP growth/ unemployment, inflation), and national series (interest rate, terms of trade, and real exchange rate). The SVAR estimation will treat the global commodity-price shocks as exogenous and evaluate the impulse responses of the macroeconomic series across regions. Of particular interest are the patterns of variance share explained by the global shocks over time.

Data files
You will find in this directory the historical data, MATLAB codes for SVAR estimation, and an app (shinyR) to create a dashboard showing both historical data and estimated responses of the variables to global commodity-price shocks by region.
